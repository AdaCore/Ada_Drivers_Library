Note that you will probably need to enable optimization (see the scenario
variable) for proper execution.

This program is set up to run on the STM32F429 Discovery boards because
it uses the LCD to display results.  This display usage is entirely for
convenience -- some other means for showing the results could be used, such
as a serial port.

Note that you will very likely need to reset the board manually for proper
execution.
