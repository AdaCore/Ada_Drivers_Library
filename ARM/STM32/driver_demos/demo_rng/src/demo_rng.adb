--  Basic demonstration of on-board RNG hardware. The function Random is called
--  iteratively, indefinitely, and the results are displayed. Some display
--  hardware is therefore assumed but the demo is otherwise independent of
--  specific boards.

--  Note that you may need to cycle power on the board.
