There are three separate main programs in this project. These programs are set
up to run on the STM32F429 Discovery boards because they use the LCD to display
results.  This display usage is entirely for convenience -- some other means
for showing the results could be used, such as a serial port.

Note that you will very likely need to reset the board manually for proper
execution.
