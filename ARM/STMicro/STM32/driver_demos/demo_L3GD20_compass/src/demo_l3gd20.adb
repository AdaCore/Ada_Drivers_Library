--  This program demonstrates the on-board gyro provided by the L3GD20 chip on
--  the STM32F429 Discovery boards. Data availability is determined by polling
--  a status flag.
--
--  The heading, along the Z axis, is continuously displayed. Values are
--  between 0 and 359 degrees. Zero degrees, i.e., "north", is at the
--  end of the board where the power cable is attached.

--  NB: You may need to reset or cycle power to the board after downloading!

--  The gyro is not physically centered on the major or minor axis of the
--  Discovery board, so when testing this program you must rotate the board
--  about the center of the gyro, not the center of the board.

--  The gyro will inevitably exhibit drift (because the F429 Discovery board
--  does not have an on-board accelerometer to provide corrective input).
