--  This package provides an interface to the on-board "independent watchdog"
--  provided by the STM32F4 family.

      Divider_128,
      Divider_256);
   --  These are the values used to control the rate at which the watchdog
   --  countdown timer counts down to zero. The clock driving the watchdog
   --  downcounter is approximately 32KHz. Thus, for example, dividing by
   --  32 gives about 1 millisecond per count.

   procedure Initialize_Watchdog
     (Prescalar : Prescalars;
      Count     : Countdown_Value);
   --  Sets the watchdog operating parameters. See the ST Micro RM0090
   --  Reference Manual, table 106 (pg 691) for the minimum and maximum timeout
   --  values possible for the range of countdown values, given any specific
   --  prescalar value.
   --
   --  Note that the counter does not begin counting as a result of calling
   --  this routine.

   procedure Start_Watchdog;
   --  Starts the counter counting down to zero. At zero the interrupt is
   --  generated to reset the board.

   procedure Reset_Watchdog;
   --  Reloads the countdown value so that the hardware reset interrupt
   --  is not generated.
