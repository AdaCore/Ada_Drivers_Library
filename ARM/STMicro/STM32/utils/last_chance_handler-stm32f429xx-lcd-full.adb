--  This version of the LCH writes the exception name and message (if any),
--  followed by the traceback, if any, to the LCD. It uses the package
--  LCD_Std_Out, and that package body elaboration assignes GPIO ports
--  and pins, as well as a SPI port, to initialize the ILI9341 component.

--  Note this version requires building with the ravenscar-full runtime.

--  The non-symbolic traceback addresses are written to the LCD. From these
--  addresses you can get the symbolic traceback using arm-eabi-addr2line on
--  the command line. For example:
--
--  arm-eabi-addr2line -e <executable> --functions --demangle <address> ...
--
--  Note that you must build with the "-E" binder switch for the traceback
--  addresses to be stored with exception occurrences.
--
--  See the GNAT User Guide, section 8.1.14. Stack Traceback for details.
