These packages represent specific implementations, "boards" such as the
`*_Discovery` kit boards.

They include the peripheral declarations for their specific MCU device, such as
the GPIO ports and timers on the F405 or F429, as well as declarations specific
to that board, such as the LEDs.

Use one of these packages if that is the specific target you are using.

Alternatively, if you have some platform that is based on a given MCU device but
is not a specific board (e.g., not one of the `*_Discovery` boards), use the
corresponding MCU device package instead.  For example, the Crazyflie 2.0 uses
an STM32F405, so package STM32F40xxx would be appropriate.  With that approach
the hardware that the `*_Discovery` boards include will not be available, such
as the user buttons.
