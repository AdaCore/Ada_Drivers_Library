--  This demo is intended for the F4 Discovery board because it uses all four
--  LEDs. Using four LEDs is not a functional necessity but driving only one or
--  two LEDs would not be that interesting. If you use a different target with
--  fewer LEDs, change the number of interrupts generated to match only the
--  number of LEDs available.
