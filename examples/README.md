# Ada_Drivers_Library examples

In this directory you will find instructions and examples to start your first
Ada_Drivers_Library project.

The goals of the examples are:
 - Offer a simple way to start a project
 - Demonstrate the supported features of the boards
 - Demonstrate the supported drivers of a micro-controller family

The examples are sorted by boards but some of them are working on multiple
boards, in that case the code is stored in the [shared](shared/) directory.

# Getting started

## Download and install the tools

### Compiler and IDE

Most of the boards/micro-controller supported are based on the ARM Cortex-M
architecture. If you have a GNAT Pro subscription, you can download the
compiler (GNAT) and IDE (GNAT Programming Studio) from your account. Otherwise,
AdaCore provides a community version of GNAT that you can download
[here](http://adacore.com/download). We recomend to download the cross compiler
and also the native one because it contains the GNAT Programming Studio IDE.

Follow the instructions to install GNAT and GPS.

### stlink

For the STM32 board we recommend to use the open-source probe interface
[stlink](https://github.com/texane/stlink).

On Windows, stlink should be included with your cross-compiler installation.

On Linux, you have to download the source and compile the tool:

```Shell
$ git clone https://github.com/texane/stlink.git
$ cd stlink
$ make release
```

### Miscellaneous

Some boards require a specific tool or configuration, in that case you will
find the additional instructions in the example directory dedicated to this
board (for instance [Micro:bit](MicroBit/)).

## Clone the repository

If you are on Windows, we recommend to use the 
[GitHub Desktop application](https://desktop.github.com/).

Otherwise, from the command line:
```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/AdaCore/Ada_Drivers_Library.git
```

## Build and install the run-times

Not all the GNAT run-times used in the Ada_Drivers_Library are packaged with
the compiler.

To build and install the missing run-times, use the `install_dependencies.py`
script:

```shell
python ./scripts/install_dependencies.py
```

## Open an example project

Start GNAT Programming Studio and open one of the project supported by the
board you have:

 - [HiFive1](HiFive1)
 - [MicroBit](MicroBit)
 - [OpenMV2 ](OpenMV2)
 - [STM32F429_Discovery](STM32F429_Discovery)
 - [STM32F469_Discovery](STM32F469_Discovery)
 - [STM32F4_DISCO](STM32F4_DISCO)
 - [STM32F746_Discovery](STM32F746_Discovery)
 - [STM32F769_Discovery](STM32F769_Discovery)

## Compile the project

Use the "Build all" button in GNAT Programming Studio tool bar.

##  Run the project

For the STM32 board, use the "Flash to board" button in the tool bar.
