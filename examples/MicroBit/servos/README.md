Servos Example
==============

In this example we will see how to control servo-motors. This
is a special case of PWM output where the period is a fixed 50 Hz,
and the pulse width varies from 500 to 1500 µs to denote a setpoint
between 0° and 180°.

For continuous servos, setpoints 0 and 180 correspond to full speed
in either direction, and 90 corresponds to neutral (stopped).
