# LCD demo

This example demonstrates working with the LCD using the
HAL.Bitmap.Bitmap_Buffer interface.
Colorful rectangles are displayed on the screen, and their
colors change based on the X and Y coordinates.

For this demo, you need an LCD, which is usually sold as
part of the STM32 F4VE board kit.
