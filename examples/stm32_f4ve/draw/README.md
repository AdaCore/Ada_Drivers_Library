# Draw on the screen

This example is a modified version of the draw example for
STM32F429 Discovery. Unlike the original, it does not use
the Framebuffer interface. Touch the screen to draw. The
thickness of points and lines during drawing depends on
the pressure applied and what you touch on the screen.

Press the K-UP button for a demo of drawing primitives.

For this demo, you need an LCD with a touch panel, which
is usually sold as part of the STM32 F4VE board kit.
